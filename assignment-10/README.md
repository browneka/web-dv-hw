 A system font refers to the fonts already on your system and device that may not be available to the web. Web fonts are those that are hosted by the server but may not be available to your device or system. Web-safe fonts are web fonts that are sure to be available on your device and system.

Fallback font or a font stack are used because not all devices, systems, and servers have all of the fonts available to them and won't be able to display fonts that aren't available so it is important to have fallback fonts that are available to devices, systems, and servers which will show up in place of the fonts that are not available.

For this assignment, I completed the readings on the course website and then followed the instructions on Moodle for assignment-10.

 1.A page can have one main document head element and should include elements such as the title. This separates the elements within the head from the rest of the page. A page can have one main body element. The body element contains all the other document text and elements such as the paragraph element. Both the head and body elements give the page structure and organization.

2.Structural markup is used to embed information about the structure of a document while semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of information within the document, such as abbreviations and emphasis.


3.After completing the readings that prepared me to complete this assignment, I created the necessary files and folders for the assignment. After making sure they were named correctly, I placed the image file of my completed recipe inside the images folder. Then I began to add the elements and text within my index.html file. After double-checking my work in the index.html file, I completed the README.md as laid out in the assignment instructions.

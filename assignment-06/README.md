1. I've come across a lot of e-mail subscription forms and quite a few asking for how I heard about whatever the website is about. Submitting my e-mail on those forms provides the URL with my e-mail address and allows them to add me to the list of people they send various e-mails to. Providing information about how I heard about the website/what the website is for, such as a company, gives them data on the best ways for them to reach more people by showing what has worked to get people there in the first place.
2. Text input can be used to ask users what comments or questions they have about the content on your page or can allow them to provide their personal information to subscribe or get more information.
Selection inputs allow users to submit information/answer questions by selecting from options provided by the webpage designer such as selecting ethnicity off a list of options.
Button inputs allow users to submit the text and/or selections on form(s) which allows them to do things such as submit comments or questions, or submit their email to subscribe.
3. I started by reading the course page information on Forms along with the textbook pages. After finishing reading and taking notes, I worked my way through the assignment instructions for the index.html. Once I completed the steps for the index.html I answered the questions for the README.md then uploaded the assignment-06 folder to my Github repository.

1. Divs allows developers to create different sections on a page. The inline equivalent of the div element is the span element. Spans can be placed within divs without creating full width blocks. The span attribute identifies content that needs organization or extra styling and groups the content together. Ids serve as global identifiers and the id for each element should have a unique id (identifier). The id attribute is valid in every HTML, as well as the class attribute. For HTML elements, the class attribute is the selector ad identifier value and groups similar kinds of elements using the same name value.
2. The "alt text" is placed within an image tag to provide text that is displayed if the image is unable to load which tells the user what the image would be if loaded.
3. I started this assignment by doing all the readings for this week. After reading, I looked at the assignment instructions and looked up a song to use and downloaded the 3 media files provided to us.  I created the folders and files as laid out on the assignment page and then began working through the steps for the index.html. After completing the index.html, I added the three parts required for the README.md and then submitted the assignment-07 folder onto my GitHub repository. I then submitted the two required links onto moodle.

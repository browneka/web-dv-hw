<p>
  Using polymer clay beads is simple and loads of fun once you know how. You can use it to make various types of jewlery, such as bracelets and necklaces. It is a fairly affordable hobby and easy to do in your own home.
</p>
<p> I use Sculpey polymer clay to make beads and other pendants and things to use in my jewlery making. Most of my jewlery is given away as gifts.
</p>
<p> The internet is full of information and ideas for polymer clay jewlery. A simply search on pinterest will give you enough tutorials to last a lifetime.

This class was my first time ever learning anyhting about HTML so it was all new to me. It was all difficult, and at times frustrating, to learn but the basics such as paragraphs and the main document elements were easiest to learn.

I'm nervous to move on to another language after going through the difficulty of the first module but I am excited to learn more.

I started this assignment by reading through the course website for this section. After that I went through the steps on Moodle for this assignment. Next I will upload the assignment to GitHub and submit the required links to Moodle.

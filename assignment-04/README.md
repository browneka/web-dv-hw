<p> On The Wayback Machine I visited www.webmd.com and looked at what it was like in the year 2000. The images on the home page no longer appear and it appeared how I would expect a website that old to. I was surprised that the advertisements on the page still showed up, except without the media. </p>

<p> I learned how to add headings and subheadings and how their numbered in order from 1-6 with 1 being the main heading. I was really interested in learning about the different one-tag and two-tag elements, as well as how to insert line breaks and horizontal rules. I am still having difficulty properly adding/linking/embedding images though this module did not talk about that topic as much as the second and third modules did. </p>

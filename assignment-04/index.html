<h1> When You Ask Me How I Got This Way </h1>

<p> i want to say
well
it’s kind of like that scene in Disney’s Alice In Wonderland
the one where the Hatter grabs the giant pocketwatch
from the panicking White Rabbit
how he declares it Two Days Slow
and then he dips it right into his coffee </p>
<p>
<br />
and
then he throws it against the table
and then he
pours salt into its springs
then he
forks out its gears
he slathers it in butter
pours tea into it
spreads jam over it
squeezes some lemon juice to finish it
like some kind of sickly oyster
and slams it shut </p>
<br />
<p> i want to ask if you remember that
but then i want to say
when i was born
something in my head
wasn’t quite right </p>
<br />
<p> but then i want to say
when i was a kid
something in my school
wasn’t quite right </p>
<br />
<p> but then i want to say
when i loved this person
something in our house
wasn’t quite right </p>
<br />
<p> so instead i say
who can really tell
what exactly broke me? </p>
<br />
<p>because on top of all of that
when the Hatter shuts the watch All Done
(as if he somehow fixed it)
it suddenly spins and sputters and freaks out
all over the dinner table
and they grab this
giant
fucking
hammer
and crush the clock to a halt anyway
which is to say:
i don’t know which damage to blame here
was that last toxic partner
the Coffee
or the Butter
or the Hammer?
which one were you?
the insult? or the injury?
does it matter? </p>
<br />
<p> do you think the Hammer might have whispered to the Watch
oh you’re already telling this all wrong anyway? </p>
<br />
<p> do you think it might have grumbled
you were already fucked up when i found you? </p>
<br />
<p> do you think the Watch apologized to the Hammer like i did? </p>
<br />
<p>do you think it said
no
no you’re right
i’m sorry
you’re right
i’m just
Two Days
Slow </p>

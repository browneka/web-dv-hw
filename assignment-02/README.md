# Assignment 2
## Katherine Browne
I decided to take this class because it is one of the few upper level classes outside of my major that did not require prerequisites and it looked interesting.
1. I've learned what a repository is.
2. I've learned basic website components.
3. I've learned what terms  that I've heard many times before, such as "URL", actually stand for.
